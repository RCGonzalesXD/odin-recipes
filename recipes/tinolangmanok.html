    <p><h3>Tinolang Manok is a great tasting and healthy dish to prepare for your family. It is easy to cook and friendly on the budget.
        It can consist of various chicken cuts and internal organs cooked in a flavorful broth alongside green papaya 
        and chili pepper or malunggay leaves. The broth is usually generously seasoned with ginger, 
        garlic, and fish sauce, and the soup is often served over plain white rice.
